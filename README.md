# Hello Full Stack

An example web app that tries to capture the many elements that go into
building a full stack application.

Currently included are:
- A minimal python web service built with
  - [flask][flask-docs] for the web framework
  - [uwsgi][uwsgi-docs] for the application server
  - [asyncio][asyncio-docs] for async
- A [Dockerfile][docker-getting-started] enabling a variety of container fun
- A [GitHub action][github-actions-docs] that builds the Dockerfile and pushes
  the resulting image to [AWS ECR][aws-ecr-dev-guide]
  - Creating the ECR repository requires one-time setup in the
    [infra repo][neural-magic-infra-repo] terraform which can be found
    [here][hello-full-stack-terraform-ecr-config].
  - Authorizing GitHub actions to access AWS resources requires one-time setup
    in the [infra repo][neural-magic-infra-repo] terraform which can be found
    [here][hello-full-stack-terraform-github-oidc-config].
    - **This should only be done for private repositories!** Otherwise, GitHub
      Actions could conceivably be used with malicious intent.
- A deployment manifest for [kubernetes][kubernetes-what-is-kubernetes] that
  describes the resources necessary to deploy the hello-full-stack application
  with:
  - A [deployment][kubernetes-deployment-docs] that includes 2 replicas to better
    ensure capacity and high availability.
  - An [Nginx Ingress][kubernetes-nginx-ingress-docs] resource to allow
    external access to the service through an AWS Elastic Load Balancer to
    better ensure capacity and high availability.
